# MyWeather
A demo application forming part of the [Xamarin University Webinar Series: Xamarin University Presents Getting Started with Xamarin](https://blog.xamarin.com/webinar-series-xamarin-university-presents-getting-started-with-xamarin/) and presented in [Building Your First iOS App with Xamarin for Visual Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/webinars/register/xamarin-university-presents--building-your-first-ios-app-with-xamarin-for-visual-studio)

The Demo iOS application is built with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) to query OpenWeatherMap.org and gather weather for a current location. 

The application is based on [MyWeather.Forms](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/MyWeather.Forms) by James Montemagno.
The app is built with C# 6 features and you must be running VS 2015 or Xamarin Studio to compile.
